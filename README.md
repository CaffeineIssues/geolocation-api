# geolocation-api

just training some express.js

if you wanna use it, use it but I might stop maintaining it at some point so be ready for that

🚀 MVP Feature Set

1. IP → Location (Geolocation by IP)
   Input: IP address
   
   Output: country, region/state, city, latitude, longitude, ISP
   
   Use cases: detect where a user is visiting from, customize content, basic fraud checks.
   
3. Coordinates → Address (Reverse Geocoding)
   Input: latitude, longitude
   
   Output: human-readable address (street, city, region, country).
   
   Use cases: delivery apps, ride-hailing, location sharing.
   
5. Address → Coordinates (Geocoding)
   Input: address string
   
   Output: latitude, longitude
   
   Use cases: store locator, user profile address validation.
   
7. Distance & Duration (Basic Routing)
   Input: two sets of coordinates
   
   Output: straight-line distance (Haversine formula) + optional road-based estimate
   
   Use cases: showing “X km away,” delivery estimates.
   
9. Time Zone Lookup
   Input: coordinates
   
   Output: local timezone, UTC offset
   
   Use cases: scheduling, meeting coordination, travel apps.


   🛠️ Technical MVP Decisions
   Data sources: Start with free/open datasets (e.g., OpenStreetMap + Nominatim for geocoding, MaxMind GeoLite2 for IP lookup).
   
   Tech stack:
   Backend: Node.js / Express (or FastAPI if Python preferred).
   Storage: Cache results with Redis for speed.
   Optional: PostGIS if you want advanced spatial queries later.
   API style: REST (simple JSON responses). GraphQL can be a later addition.
   📈 Future Expansion (Post-MVP)
   Geofencing (enter/exit area events)
   Place search (restaurants, landmarks)
   Route optimization (multi-stop trips)
   Real-time tracking (WebSocket streaming)
   Fraud/anomaly detection (location jumps, VPN detection)
